O.K.
question dot name
O. K. And then

O. K. And then | guess we need to actually append all
O. K. And then | guess we need to actually append all of these

things to each other. So
we can say
things to each other. So
we can say question
things to each other. So
we can say question div
things to each other. So
we can say question div dot append
things to each other. So
we can say question div dot append the
things to each other. So
we can say question div dot append the H three
things to each other. So
we can say question div dot append the H 3.
we can say question div dot append the H 3.
So this will add
we can say question div dot append the H 3.
So this will add the H
we can say question div dot append the H 3.
So this will add the H three to
we can say question div dot append the H 3.
So this will add the H three to the question
we can say question div dot append the H 3.
So this will add the H three to the question div
we can say question div dot append the H 3.
So this will add the H three to the question div and then
So this will add the H three to the question div and then we need to
add
So this will add the H three to the question div and then we need to
add the
So this will add the H three to the question div and then we need to

So this will add the H three to the question div and then we need to
add the question div to
So this will add the H three to the question div and then we need to
add the question div to the categ
So this will add the H three to the question div and then we need to
add the question div to the category div
So this will add the H three to the question div and then we need to
add the question div to the category div and to
So this will add the H three to the question div and then we need to
add the question div to the category div and to rename
So this will add the H three to the question div and then we need to
add the question div to the category div and to rename this just so
add the question div to the category div and to rename this just so
we can keep track
add the question div to the category div and to rename this just so
we can keep track of it better
add the question div to the category div and to rename this just so
we can keep track of it better to categ
add the question div to the category div and to rename this just so
we can keep track of it better to category div
the question div to the category div and to rename this just so we
can keep track of it better to category div.
can keep track of it better to category div.
okay
can keep track of it better to category div.
okay. So then
can keep track of it better to category div.
okay. So then we can
can keep track of it better to category div.
okay. So then we can say
can keep track of it better to category div.
okay. So then we can say category div
okay. So then we can say category division.

questions so this will return that array and then we also are going
to want to take these questions and transform them like | said so
let's make another function that is going to take in the questions
and return them in this sort of transformed way so we can say
function and let's call this | don't know let's say get.

questions by category OK

and this will take in the questions which is that array

and let's see so we need to first of all iterate through the array and
add to some object based on the categories. So we can first of all
create the object so constant
question

and make an arrow function.

So what do we need to do here? So we need to add two questions
by category at the.

the category as the like the key but we need to know if that's
already there or not so we can say if questions by category and

we need to do | guess has own properties that we can say if it's

will create a division. And we can say div dot classlist dot add the

And then we need all of the questions. So we can say questions
and let's iterate through the questions. So this questions is going t
be the array that we added in questions by category. So it is sort of
this array or the array that we were pushing to

So let's say questions .for each.

question.

And let's see what do we need to do. So we need to create a div
with the class of question. So constant question div just to give it a
different name than the outer div is going to be equal to
documents dot create element of a div and then we need to give it
the question class. So question div dot class list dot add question
and then it needs an H3 inside of it as well. So constant H3 is goinc
to be document dot create element of an H3

and then we need to set the text content of that H3. So H3 dot text
content is going to be equal to the.

question and we need to get from the API the name. So question
dot name.

okay. And then | guess we need to actually append all of these
things to each other. So

we can say question div dot append the H 3.

So this will add
and then it needs an H3 inside of it as well. So constant H3 is goinc
to be document dot create element of an H3

and then we need to set the text content of that H3. So H3 dot text
content is going to be equal to the.

question and we need to get from the API the name. So question
dot name.

okay. And then | guess we need to actually append all of these
things to each other. So

we can say question div dot append the H 3.

So this will add the H three to the
and then it needs an H3 inside of it as well. So constant H3 is goinc

and then we need to set the text content of that H3. So H3 dot text

question and we need to get from the API the name. So question

okay. And then | guess we need to actually append all of these

we can say question div dot append the H 3.

So this will add the H three to the question
and then it needs an H3 inside of it as well. So constant H3 is goinc

question and we need to get from the API the name. So question
dot name.
okay. And then | guess we need to actually append all of these

we can say question div dot append the H 3.

So this will add the H three to the question div
and then it needs an H3 inside of it as well. So constant H3 is goinc
to be document dot create element of an H3
and then we need to set the text content of that H3. So H3 dot text

okay. And then | guess we need to actually append all of these

okay. And then | guess we need to actually append all of these

we can say question div dot append the H 3.

So this will add the H three to the question div and then we need t

pointed out on the front expert page there is an order like the orde
is always the same for the purpose of this question don't worry
about the order

So however you know the way you you structured your code all the
categories are gonna be in your object. Don't worry about you
know what order they're in the object in okay cool awesome. So to
iterate through the object | guess there's a few ways we can do it
but | kind of like the object dot entries functions let's do or for
constant and we'll have the key and then the values. | guess the ke
is the category and the value

is the category and the value is the questions.

and this will be of object dot entries question.

by category

OK so this just iterates through the object gets every category and
the questions for that category so then we can say

constant category is equal to create category and we can just pass
in the category and the questions and then we just need to appenc
this to the page so we can get that wrapper that you said we had.
So document dot get element by ID

the wrapper and I'll do this

So document dot get element by ID

the wrapper and I'll do this at the top of the function just so we
only have to do it one time or the top of the 4 loop so.

OK and let me just double check.

it is. Yeah, it is
the questions for that category so then we can say
